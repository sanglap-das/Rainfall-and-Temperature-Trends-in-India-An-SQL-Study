## Project Description

#### Data Description :
In this project, we've utilized two datasets obtained from an open-source data repository platform.
The initial dataset presents Indian Subdivision-wise Rainfall data spanning from 1901 to 2017,
while the second dataset encompasses yearly Temperature data for India during the same time frame.

#### Objective :
**Data Cleaning:** Clean and prepare the data for analysis.

**Database Queries:** Extract specific information efficiently using SQL.

**EDA Insights:** Reveal data patterns and trends.

**Climate Change Impact:** Assess climate change effects on India's climate.

**Correlation Analysis:** Identify relationships between rainfall and temperature.

**Regional Variations:** Explore spatial variations in climate data.

**Forecasting Values :** Forecast future climate trends using historical data.

**Visualizations:** Use interactive visuals to convey results effectively.

**Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive project documentation.
